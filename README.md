# 3M Stock (MMM) Analysis Dashboard
Welcome to the 3M Stock (MMM) Analysis Dashboard, a comprehensive and interactive platform designed to provide valuable insights and risk metrics for investors interested in 3M stock.

# Methodology
To provide a comprehensive analysis, we have employed several advanced techniques and methodologies:

### Non-parametric VaR: 
I have used the Epanechnikov Kernel to implement the non-parametric VaR, which offers a more flexible and robust approach to assessing potential losses.
### Annualized Volatility: 
I have calculated the annualized volatility using the Hurst exponent, which takes into account the long-term memory of the time series and provides a more accurate measure of the stock's volatility.

### Trading Hours Data: 
The analysis is based solely on data collected during trading hours, specifically between Monday and Friday, and between the Opening and Closing Prices. This ensures that the risk metrics are more representative of the actual trading dynamics.


# Daily Report Updates
To keep the 3M Stock Analysis Dashboard up-to-date, we automatically update the platform with the latest stock data every day at 22:00 (10 PM). By updating the data after the Closing Price is determined, we ensure that our risk metrics and analysis are always based on the most recent and relevant information.
